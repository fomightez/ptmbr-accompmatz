    "\n",
    "This notebook is to demonstrate `matches_a_patmatch_pattern.py`.  \n",
    "The script takes a pattern in [PatMatch syntax](https://www.yeastgenome.org/nph-patmatch#examples) and a sequence (either a FASTA sequence file or text string) and reports if there is a match present. With the `match_over_entirety` option, it reports if the squence represents a specific example of the generalized pattern. For example, is the sequence `ATTGATATAAGTAATAGATA` a specific example matching the pattern `DDWDWTAWAAGTARTADDDD`?\n",
