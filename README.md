# ptmbr-accompmatz
Companion repository for my [patmatch-binder](https://github.com/fomightez/patmatch-binder) repository. This contains the accompanying material and guides that are aside from the core PatMatch software.

The notebooks here get copied into active sessions launched from the 'patmatch-binder' repository [here](https://github.com/fomightez/patmatch-binder). To learn more about PatMatch, see [here](https://github.com/fomightez/patmatch-binder).

To use these notebooks actively, click the `launch binder` badge below:

## Technical Details

This was done so that development of the accompanying material for the patmatch-binder repo could continue without need for rebuilding the associated images at MyBinder.org or Cyverse.


I borrrowed the 'warning' highlight/introductory text about notebooks at the top of the first two included notebooks from Tim Sherratt's notebook [here](https://github.com/GLAM-Workbench/te-papa-api/blob/master/Exploring-the-Te-Papa-collection-API.ipynb).
