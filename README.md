Accompanying material for my [patmatch-binder]((https://github.com/fomightez/patmatch-binder)) repository.

The companion notebooks here get copied into active sessions launched from the 'patmatch-binder' repository [here](https://github.com/fomightez/patmatch-binder). To learn more about PatMatch, see [here](https://github.com/fomightez/patmatch-binder).

To use these notebooks actively, click the `launch binder` badge below:

## Technical Details

This was done so that development of the accompanying material for the patmatch-binder repo could continue without need for rebuilding the associated images at MyBinder.org or Cyverse.
